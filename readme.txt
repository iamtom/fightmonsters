I would describe this game as a practice in creating the basis of an RPG game.
Right now, it does not play much like a real RPG but the potential is there to turn it
into a more 'playable' game, which is something I will do in the future. All there is right now 
is a simple GUI and all the code for calculating stats, battle outcomes, etc. There
are some random encounters and one boss.
